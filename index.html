        Cognitiates and neophyte mechwrights alike shall make use of this instructional docufile
        regarding some of the sacred mysteries of the Machine Spirit. Not all Machine Spirits are
        alike, though all have commonalities. Especially those running logic-rituals based upon the
        sacred binary-lang known in the ancient antiquity of the Second Millenium as "JavaScript".
        Though an ancient bi-lang, JavaScript finds use in many STCs for its relatively simple logic.
        Machine Rites constructed in this bi-lang often contain some or all of the following entries.

        Supplicants may use the navigation cogiQuan (cogitation quantum) to engage with different 
        segments of the Educatus Tutorium.

        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <h3><i>Sacred Rotes of the Machine Spirit</i></h3>
        <p>In the JavaScript cogitator language, a <i>Function</i> is a programmable procedure
        which you can utilize to perform various tasks or calculate various values. By setting
        variables (using variable declarations such as "let" or "var"), you can program your Function
        to investigate these variables or utilize them in calculations. It can be thought of as a sort of
        "sub-program" which runs inside of your code. Values (such as variables) can be defined outside 
        of a function and then passed into it, but you must be careful to place the function itself
        within the scope in which you wish to use it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Below, you will find an example of this type of cogitation-sorcery:</p>
        <pre><code>
        function withTaxPrice(x){
            let productCost= x;
            let salesTax = x*0.07;
            let total= productCost + salesTax;
                console.log(total, "Throne Gelt");
        return total;
            }
            
        withTaxPrice(10);</code></pre>

        <h2>Conditionals</h2>
        <h3><i>Mysterious Logics of the Machine Spirit</i></h3>
        <p>Conditionals allow a tech priest to control the behavior of their programs, functions,
        and so forth by evaluating if certain conditions have been met and then running processes
        if they have. They also allow you to create chains and loops of multiple logic gates to check
        for several different conditions and have prepared contingencies. "If" is the most common
        Conditional statement. It allows you to both check if something is "truthy", and propose a
        consequence in the case that it is. A truthy statement is one which evaluates to "true".
        Other Conditional statements (for example "Else If") can be chained onto an initial "If" to present alternative outcomes
        in the case that other statements turn out to be truthy, or even in the case that none of
        the prepared arguments are truthy (an ending "Else" statement).
        </p>
        <p>Below, you will find an example of this type of cogitation-sorcery:</p>
        <pre><code>
        var temperature= 75;
            if (temperature > 70){
                console.log("Better wear shorts! It's gonna be a hot one today!")
            } else if (temperature <= 70 && temperature > 60){
                console.log("It's gonna be pretty nice out today.")
            } else { console.log("Better dress warm!")</code></pre>

        <h2>Arrays</h2>
        <h3><i>Holy Data-Armory of the Machine Spirit</i></h3>
        <p>
        Arrays are powerful code-vaults which behave in a way not unlike a large container into
        which can be placed all manner of values. They are themselves a sort of variable, and can
        be used to contain a long list of values, even those of different datatypes. Arrays can
        even contain other arrays. The contents of an array (the array's "elements") are counted using
        keys starting from 0; this is an important thing to remember when attempting to access the 
        data stored within an array. In order to make use of these powerful aspects of a
        Machine Spirit, you must know that arrays have "methods" and "properties". These are commands
        such as ".length" (which allows you to evaluate the number of elements in an array), ".concat"
        (which allows you to fuse two extant arrays), or ".reverse" (which returns a copy of the array
        in opposite order). These built-in methods for manipulating arrays makes them very versatile
        containers, indeed.</p>
        <p>Below, you will find an example of this type of cogitation-sorcery:</p>
        <pre><code>
        let charStats = ["Str", "Dex", "Con", "Int", "Wis", "Cha"];
            console.log(charStats[1]); //output-> "Dex"

        //or if you have a long and unwieldy array and want to return only the last 
        //element in an array, you could do something like this:
        
        let magicSchools = ["Enchantment", "Necromancy", "Transmutation", "Conjuration", "Divination",
        "Evocation", "Illusion", "Abjuration"];
            console.log(magicSchools[magicSchools.length - 1]); //output-> "Abjuration"
        
        //this works because arrays start numbering the keys for their elements at 0.
        </code></pre>
